clipper
=======

Haskell bindings for clipper (a C++/C#/Delphi API for 2d polygon algerbric ops)
(c) Chetan Taralekar 2011, 2012


Adapted to build against clipper-5.1.6.
It is assumed to be locally installed, e.g.
# cd clipper-5.1.6/cpp
# cmake .
# sudo cmake install

This package is built with Makefile (driving cabal) to customize C compiler and options,
clipper lib is in C++, so a number of hacks needs to be applied to adapt.

N.B. pulling clipper C++ lib into cbits results in un-usable ghci,
search for "ghci weak symbol".
